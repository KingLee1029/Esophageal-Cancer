This project is a comprehensive genomic analysis workflow designed to perform a series of bioinformatics analyses, including but not limited to:Mendelian Randomization (MR) Analysis: To infer causal relationships between genetic variants and phenotypes.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA): To identify biological pathways and processes enriched in gene sets.Immune Infiltration Analysis: To assess the composition of immune cells in samples using deconvolution methods like CIBERSORT.Survival Analysis and Prediction Modeling: To build and validate predictive models for survival outcomes.Single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) Analysis: To analyze and interpret single-cell gene expression data.
